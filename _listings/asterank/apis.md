description: Asterank is a scientific and economic database of over 600,000 asteroids.
  Weve collected, computed, or inferred important data such as asteroid mass and composition
  from multiple scientific sources. With this information, we estimate the costs and
  rewards of mining asteroids. Details on orbits and basic physical parameters are
  sourced from the Minor Planet Center and NASA JPL. Composition data is based on
  spectral classification and size. Our calculations incorporate conclusions from
  multiple scientific publications in addition to cross-referencing known meteorite
  data.
